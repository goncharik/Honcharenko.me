This is where I share my thoughts and reviews on the books I'm reading. As a developer, I mostly gravitate toward fantasy and sci-fi, but I'm always open to exploring different genres. Whether it's a page-turner that kept me up all night or a thought-provoking read that changed my perspective, I'll share my honest take on each book.

I'd love if you join me on this reading journey! Reading the same book and discussing it with others brings so much more. Different perspectives, catching details you might have missed, and those "aha!" moments when someone points out something brilliant you hadn't considered. If you're reading or have read any of the books I'm covering, I'd be glad to discuss them with you. Feel free to reach out on any social platform where you can find me!

**Project Hail Mary** by **Andy Weir**

I'm usually more of a fantasy reader than sci-fi, but this one kept popping up with glowing reviews from people who are into fantasy like me. Plus, there's a movie with Ryan Gosling coming out this spring based on this book, and I want to read it first before hitting the cinema. What better way to kick off the new year than with an awesome new book that's got everyone talking?
