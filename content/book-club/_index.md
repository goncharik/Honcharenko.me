**Currently Reading:** Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir

I'm usually more of a fantasy reader than sci-fi, but this one kept popping up with glowing reviews from people who are into fantasy like me. Plus, there's a movie with Ryan Gosling coming out this spring based on this book, and I want to read it first before hitting the cinema. What better way to kick off the new year than with an awesome new book that's got everyone talking?
