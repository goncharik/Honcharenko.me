### Review of _Carl's Doomsday Scenario_ by Matt Dinniman

It was a pleasure to return to Dungeon Crawler Carl after a two-month pause. I rushed through book 2 in about three days, which tells you everything you need to know about how engaging it is. It felt shorter than the first one, but definitely not lighter on the action.

It’s still the same crazy dungeon world we know and love, but this time level 3 comes with its own theme and storyline. I won’t spoil what it is - just go read it!

What I will say is that this level introduces quests, and they bring an unexpected detective element to the fantasy action. You actually have to think alongside Carl and Donut as they work through the puzzles. And because of that? Way more plot twists than I expected.

There’s also more development on the drama happening outside the dungeon that started brewing in book 1. The stakes keep getting higher on multiple fronts.

Just a masterpiece. If you’ve read the first book, you already know you’re picking this one up. And if you haven’t read the first book yet - why are you still here? Go start from the beginning!

**Rating: 5/5**
